Hdlcpp is a header-only C++11 framing protocol optimized for embedded communication. It uses the [HDLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Data_Link_Control) asynchronous framing format for handling data integrity and retransmissions. Hdlcpp is the successor of the [yahdlc](https://github.com/bang-olufsen/yahdlc) implementation written in C.

## Usage

Hdlcpp requires that a transport read and write function is supplied as e.g. a [lambda expression](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda) for the actual data transport. Hereby Hdlcpp can easily be integrated e.g. with different UART implementations. It is also possible to increase the buffer size for encoding/decoding data, write timeout and number of write retries when constructing the instance.

```c++
hdlcpp = std::make_shared<Hdlcpp::Hdlcpp>(
    [this](uint8_t *data, uint16_t length) { return serial->read(data, length); },
    [this](const uint8_t *data, uint16_t length) { return serial->write(data, length); },
    bufferSize, writeTimeout, writeRetries);
```

To read and write data using Hdlcpp the read and write functions are used. These could again e.g. be used as lambdas expressions to a protocol implementation (layered architecture). The protocol could e.g. be [nanopb](https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb).

```c++
protocol = std::make_shared<Protocol>(
    [this](uint8_t *data, uint16_t length) { return hdlcpp->read(data, length); },
    [this](const uint8_t *data, uint16_t length) { return hdlcpp->write(data, length); });
```

## Python binding

A python binding made using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) can be found under the [python](https://github.com/bang-olufsen/hdlcpp/tree/master/python) folder which can be used e.g. for automated testing.

## HDLC implementation

The supported HDLC frames are limited to DATA (I-frame with Poll bit), ACK (S-frame Receive Ready with Final bit) and NACK (S-frame Reject with Final bit). All DATA frames are acknowledged or negative acknowledged. The Address and Control fields uses the 8-bit format which means that the highest sequence number is 7. The FCS field is 16-bit.

Acknowledge of frame | Negative acknowledge of frame | Acknowledge of frame lost
